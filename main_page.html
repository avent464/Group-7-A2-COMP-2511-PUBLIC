            Our informational website provides resources that are designed to help current and prospective
            students explore the Computer Science program at Mount Royal University. It provides detailed 
            outlines of all available courses and curriculum, including possible schedule layouts to assist 
            with academic planning. Visitors can also discover the wide range of career opportunities that 
            a degree in Computer Science can lead to.

      <h3> Our Goal </h3>
      <p>
        Our goal for this website is to be able to provide the information that we believe would be useful for people who are interested in possibly pursuing a
        degree in Computer Sceince. As students, we had some troubles finding things when searching about the degree and what we could do with it. Our hope is 
        to be able to condense the information into one website so it would make learning more about the degree very efficient!

        <h2> What is Computer Science ? </h2>
        <p> 
          Computer Science is the study of computers, software, and the principles that govern how they work. It involves learning how to design, write, 
          and improve computer programs, understand how data is processed and stored, and solve real-world problems using technology. The field combines 
          creativity, logic, and problem-solving to build everything from apps and websites to artificial intelligence and cybersecurity systems.
